                        <p>The Pen tool is one of the most
                            widely used tools in any vector 
                           drawing app. Let’s dive into the 
                           possibilities of this tool in Amadine
                            for Mac, iPad and iPhone.Throughout
                            the article, you may find instructions 
                           asking you to “click”, meaning the 
                           primary button mouse click
                           . These are used for the Mac version 
                           of the app equipped with a mouse,
                            while, for your trackpad, Apple Pencil, 
                           iPhone and iPad, they simply 
                           transform into “tap”.</p>

                        <h4>My journey at Andela Rwanda</h4>
                        <p> I got interested in the andela program because of all the success stories that I kept on hearing from my friends. It all started from a rumor that one of our highschool classmates had recently purchased a car after just one year from finishing the program. Knowing the guy I called him up and asked him personally if the rumors were true to which he vigorously denied. However, besides him not buying a car his actual story was not far from impressive on its own. He suggested that I should join the next cohort and after a long conversation he gave me the application link and the rest is history. After about two months or so since I joined the program I can safely say that this has been a true Oasis of growth. On a technical point of view, I got to enhance my skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript to a whole new level and even got to learn about figma and node js which in turn helped me  build my first fully functional website. Pretty awesome right! And on a personal note, I got to meet people with the same passion and drive that I have and these people later on became my friends, some even closer than I expected. So to me, never mind the car, as long as I get to see myself grow and make a few good friends along the way I am good.</p>

                        Graphic design can be an awful lot of trouble at the beginning. from learning the user interface to getting aquinted with the dredful pentool, things can messy very quickly. That’s where sketchy comes to save the day
